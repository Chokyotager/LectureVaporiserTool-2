26320	28240	Welcome to Foundations of Computational
28240	30320	and Systems Biology.
30320	31720	This course has many numbers.
31720	35400	Just we'll explain all the differences and similarities.
35400	39600	But briefly, there are three undergrad course numbers,
39600	44720	which are all similar in content, 736, 2390, 6802.
44720	49440	And then there are four graduate versions.
49440	55480	The 791, 2490, and HST versions are all very similar,
55480	56960	basically identical.
56960	62320	But the 6874 has some additional AI content that we'll
62320	64400	discuss in a moment.
64400	67240	So make sure that you are registered for the
67240	71160	appropriate version of this course.
71160	75680	And please interrupt with questions at any time.
75680	79280	The main goal today is to kind of give an overview of the
79280	84160	course, both the content as well as sort of the mechanics
84160	85560	of how the course will be taught.
85560	88280	And we want to make sure that everything is clear.
88280	92000	So this course is taught by myself, Chris Burge from
92000	96400	Biology, Professor Frankel from BE, and Professor Gifford
96400	98920	from EECS.
98920	105840	We have three TAs, Peter Fries, and Collette Picard from
105840	111920	Computational and Systems Biology, and Tahin from EECS.
111920	114880	All the TAs have expertise in computational biology as well
114880	120640	as other quantitative areas like math, statistics,
120640	122320	computer science.
122320	125040	So in addition to the lectures by the regular instructors,
125040	129400	we'll also have guest lectures by George Church from
129400	132520	Harvard toward the end of the semester.
132520	136080	Doug Loffenberger will give a lecture in the
136080	138440	regulatory network section of the course.
138440	141680	And we'll have a guest lecture from Ron Weiss on
141680	143080	synthetic biology.
143240	146160	And so just to note that today's lecture and all the
146160	151160	lectures this semester are being recorded by Amps, by
151160	152960	MIT's OpenCourseWare.
152960	156080	So the videos, after a little bit of editing, will
156080	159200	eventually end up on OpenCourseWare.
159200	159960	What are these courses?
159960	165880	So these course numbers are the graduate level versions,
165880	169160	which are survey courses in computational biology.
169160	172680	Our target audience is graduate students who have a solid
172680	177760	background and background in biology, and also a
177760	181160	comfort with quantitative approaches.
181160	183520	We don't assume that you've programmed before, but there
183520	188040	will be some programming content on the homeworks, and
188040	192480	you will therefore need to learn some Python programming.
192480	196280	And the TAs will help with that component of the course.
196280	199800	We also have some online tutorials on Python
199800	202280	programming that are available.
202280	205960	The undergrad course numbers, this is an upper level
205960	208800	undergraduate survey course in computational biology.
208800	213480	And our target audience are upper level undergraduates with
213480	215520	solid biology background and comfort with
215520	216440	quantitative approaches.
216440	219480	So there's one key difference between the graduate and
219480	222560	undergraduate versions, which I'll come to in a moment.
222560	225920	So the goal of this course is to develop understanding of
225920	229120	foundational methods in computational biology that
229120	233760	will enable you to contextualize and understand a good
233760	236000	portion of research literature in the growing field.
236000	238840	So if you pick up science or nature or
238840	243440	post-computational biology, and you want to read those
243440	245640	papers and understand them, after this course, you will
245640	247000	have a better chance.
247000	249560	We're not guaranteeing you'll be able to understand all
249560	254240	them, but you'll be able to recognize perhaps the
254240	256960	category of paper, the class, and perhaps some of the
256960	260600	algorithms that are involved.
260600	265760	And for the graduate version, another goal is to help you
265760	267360	gain exposure to research in this field.
267360	270760	So it's actually possible to do a smaller scale
270760	273080	computational biology research project on your own, on your
273080	277680	laptop, perhaps on Athena with relatively limited
277680	280880	computational resources, and potentially even discover
280880	282200	something new.
282200	284720	And so we want to give you that experience.
284720	287520	And that's through the project component that we'll say
287520	289280	more about in a moment.
289280	292240	So just to make sure that everyone's in the right class.
292240	295840	So this is not a systems biology class.
295840	298040	There are some more focused systems biology classes
298040	298960	offered on campus.
298960	302120	But we will cover some topics that are important for
302120	304400	analyzing complex systems.
304400	308160	There's also certainly not a synthetic biology course.
308160	311200	Some of the systems methods are also used in synthetic
311200	312040	biology.
312040	314440	And there will be this guest lecture mentioned
314440	318040	Ron Weiss, which will cover synthetic biology.
318040	320560	It's also not an algorithms class.
320560	323560	We don't assume that you have experience in designing or
323560	325320	analyzing algorithms.
325320	328240	We'll discuss various bioinformatics algorithms.
328240	331840	And you'll have the opportunity to implement at least one
331840	336080	bioinformatics algorithm on your homework.
336080	339640	But it's not, algorithms are not really the center of the
339640	339960	course.
339960	342760	And there's one exception to this, which is those of you
342760	346320	who are taking 6, 8, 7, 4, will go to a special recitation
346320	350320	that will cover more advanced algorithm content.
350320	353440	And there will be special homework problems for you as
353440	353640	well.
353640	358200	So that course really does have more algorithm content.
358200	361600	So the plan for today is that I will just do a brief sort
361600	363560	of anecdotal history of computational
363560	366360	and systems biology to sort of set the stage and the
366360	367640	context for the class.
367640	371400	And then we'll spend a significant amount of time
371440	375120	reviewing the course, mechanics, organization, and content.
375120	377960	Because as you'll see, it's a little bit complicated, but
377960	382520	it all makes sense once we go over it, hopefully.
382520	386960	So this is my sort of just my take on computational
386960	387560	systems biology.
387560	389880	Again, it's not a scholarly overview.
389880	392760	It doesn't hit everything important that happened.
392760	396840	It just sort of gives you a flavor of what was happening
396920	401880	in computational biology, sort of decade by decade.
401880	408040	So first of all, where does this field fall, sort of in the
408040	409480	academic scheme of things?
409480	415000	So I consider computational biology to be actually part of
415000	415600	biology.
415600	421160	So in the way that genetics or biochemistry are disciplines
421160	424400	that have strategies for understanding biological
424400	427040	questions, so does computational biology.
427040	429840	You can use it to understand a variety of computational
429840	434920	questions in gene regulation, many of their areas.
434920	439360	There is also some people make a distinction that biopharmatics
439360	443840	is more about building tools, whereas computational biology
443840	447320	is more about using tools, for example, although many
447320	450480	people don't, it's very blurry and don't try to, you know,
450480	453320	people use them in various ways.
453320	455240	And then you could think of biopharmatics as being
455240	459600	embedded in the larger field of informatics where you include
459600	463280	tools for management and analysis of data in general.
463280	467640	And certainly through that, many of the core concepts and
467640	471120	algorithms in biopharmatics come from the field, you know,
471120	474040	come from computer science, come from other branches of
474040	477600	engineering from statistics, mathematics, and so forth.
477600	479640	So it's really a cross-disciplinary field.
479640	483080	And then synthetic biology sort of cuts across in the sense
483080	486000	that it's really an engineering discipline, because
486000	488920	you're designing and engineering synthetic molecular
488920	491960	cellular systems, but you can also use synthetic biology to
491960	496160	help understand natural biological systems, of course.
496160	498880	All right, so what was happening decade by decade?
498880	503840	So in the 70s, there were not genome sequences available or
503840	506640	large sequence databases of any sort, except there were
506640	508320	starting to be some protein sequences.
508320	512520	And early computational biologists focused on comparing
512520	517840	proteins, understanding their function, structure, and
517840	518360	evolution.
518360	522280	And so in order to compare proteins, you need a protein,
522280	525760	a amino acid substitution matrix, a matrix that describes
525760	528680	how often one amino acid is substituted for another.
528680	531760	And Margaret Dayhoff was a pioneer in developing these
531760	532560	sorts of matrices.
532560	535760	And some of the matrices she developed, the PAM series,
535760	536720	are still used today.
536720	541000	And we'll discuss those matrices early next week.
541080	545400	So in terms of asking evolutionary questions, two big
545400	551800	thinkers were Russ Doolittle and Carl Woz, analyzing both
551800	554960	ribosomal RNA sequences to study evolution.
554960	558960	And Carl Woz realized, looking at these RNA alignments, that
558960	562360	actually the prokaryotes, which had been, there was this big
562360	564800	split between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, was sort of a
564800	567880	false split, but actually there was a subgroup of single
567880	572560	celled a nuclear organisms that were closer to the eukaryotes
572560	573960	and named them the RKS.
573960	576280	So a whole sort of kingdom of life was recognized really
576280	578400	by sequence analysis.
578400	582400	And Russ Doolittle also did a lot of analysis approaching
582400	584680	sequences and sort of came up with this sort of molecular
584680	586840	clock idea.
586840	590840	Or anyway, contributed to that idea to actually build,
590840	593720	instead of systematics being based on phenotypic
593720	597800	characteristics, do it on a molecular level.
597800	600800	So in the 80s, the databases started to expand.
600800	604040	Sequence alignment and search became more important.
604040	609000	And various people developed fast algorithms to compare
609000	612560	protein and DNA sequences and align them.
612560	616200	So the FAST-A program was widely used, BLAST.
616200	617800	Several authors of BLAST are shown here.
617800	621600	Dave Lipman, Pearson, Lev Miller, Stephen Altschill.
621600	625640	The statistics for knowing when a BLAST search result is
625680	628160	significant or developed by Carlin and Altschill.
628160	632200	And there was also progress in gapped alignment, particularly
632200	636520	Smith Waterman, shown above, also progress in RNA,
636520	640320	secondary structure prediction from Newsonov and Zukar.
640320	644800	We'll talk about all of these algorithms during the course.
644800	648120	And there was also development of literature databases.
648120	649920	I always like this picture.
649920	653800	Many of you probably used PubMed, but Al Gore was well
653800	657560	coached here by these experts on how to use it.
657560	661840	And then in the 90s, computational biology really
661840	662800	started to expand.
662800	666080	It was driven partly by the development of microarrays,
666080	670320	the first genome sequences, and questions like how to
670320	673640	identify domains in a protein, how to identify genes in the
673640	678400	genome, where it was recognized that this family of models
678400	683040	from electrical engineering, the hidden markup model, were
683040	685800	quite useful for these sort of sequence labeling problems.
685800	689320	That was really pioneered by Anders Krobe here and David
689320	690280	Hausler.
690280	693600	And a variety of algorithms were developed that performed
693600	697080	these useful tasks.
697080	700960	There's also important progress in the earliest
700960	703720	comparative genomic approaches.
703720	707080	Since the first genomes were sequenced in the mid-90s of
707080	709720	free-living organisms, and so you could then start to
709720	711400	compare these genomes and learn a lot.
711400	714200	We'll talk a little bit about comparative genomics.
714200	718200	And there was important progress on predicting protein
718200	722120	structure from primary sequence, particularly David Baker
722120	725080	made notable progress on this Rosetta algorithm.
725080	728040	So it's sort of a biophysics field, but it's very much
728040	732320	part of computational biology as well.
732320	738400	So in the 2000s, definitely genome sequencing became very
738400	741560	fashionable, as you can see here.
741560	749760	And the genomes of now larger organisms, including human,
749760	751480	became possible to sequence them.
751480	754320	And then this introduced a huge host of computational
754320	757680	challenges in assembling the genomes, annotating the
757680	758520	genomes, and so forth.
758520	763240	And we'll hear from Professor Gifford about some genome
763240	764560	assembly topics.
764560	767760	And annotation will come up throughout.
771360	776120	Actually, as I just mentioned, this is Jim Kent, who did
776120	778720	the first human genome assembly that was widely used and
778720	780960	also involved in UCSC.
780960	787160	And here, Ewan Berni has started ensemble and continues to
787160	789080	run it today.
789080	790800	You know that these other people are from.
790800	792000	OK.
792000	799520	All right, so in another phase of the last decade, I would
799520	805720	say that much of biological research became sort of more
805720	807560	high throughput than it was before.
807560	810120	So molecular biology had traditionally, in the 80s and
810120	813520	90s, mostly focused on analysis of individual gene
813520	815360	of protein products.
815360	818960	But now, it became possible and sort of in widespread use
818960	822400	that you could measure the expression of all the genes
822400	825960	in theory using micro arrays, for example, and you could
825960	829880	start to profile all of the transcripts in the cell, all
829880	833640	of the proteins in the cell, and so forth.
833640	836440	And then a variety of groups started to use some of these
836440	840320	high throughput data to study various challenges in gene
840320	843880	expression, to understand how transcription works, how
843880	847480	splicing works, how microRNAs work, translation, epigenetics,
847480	847920	and so forth.
847920	854960	So you'll hear updates on some of that work in this course.
854960	859040	Bioimage informatics, particularly for developmental
859040	862600	biology, became popular, continues to be sort of a new
862600	865280	emerging area.
865280	871280	Systems biology was also really sort of born around 2000,
871280	874960	roughly sort of a very prominent example would be the
874960	879840	development of the first gene regulatory network models
879840	883840	that describe sea urchin development here by Eric Davidson,
883840	889000	as well as a whole variety of models of other gene networks
889000	891720	in the cell that control things like cell proliferation,
891720	896680	apoptosis, et cetera.
896680	902440	At the same time, a new field of synthetic biology was born
902440	905960	with the development of some of the first completely
905960	909640	artificial gene networks that would then
909640	914240	program cells to perform desired behavior.
914240	916840	So an example would be this so-called repressilator,
916840	920080	where you have a network of three transcription factors,
920080	922880	each represses the other, and then one of them
922880	924240	represses GFP.
924240	927440	And you put these into bacteria, and it causes oscillations
927440	931840	in GFP expression that are described by these differential
931840	933440	equations here.
933440	938040	And some of the modeling approaches used in synthetic biology
938040	942000	will be covered by Professor Frankl and Loffenberg
942000	944200	related.
944200	946600	All right, so late 2000s, early 2010s,
946600	949560	it's still too early to say for sure
949560	953040	what the most important developments will be.
953040	958120	But certainly in the late 2000s, next-gen sequencing,
958120	960280	which now probably should be called second-generation
960280	964280	sequencing since there may be future generations,
964280	969000	really started to transform a whole wide variety
969000	973120	of applications in biology from making genome sequencing.
973120	975040	Instead of having to be done at a genome center,
975040	978640	now an individual lab can easily do microbial genome sequencing.
978640	981600	And when needed, it's possible also
981600	985160	to do genome sequencing of larger organisms.
985160	988960	Transcriptome sequencing is now routine.
988960	991200	You'll hear about that.
991200	995480	There are applications for mapping protein DNA interactions
995480	998240	genome-wide, including both sequence-specific transcription
998240	1001840	factors, as well as more general factors like histones,
1001840	1004760	protein RNA interactions, method called clip-seq,
1004760	1007840	methods for mapping all the translated messages,
1007840	1010680	the methylated sites in the genome,
1010680	1012720	open chromatin, and so forth.
1012720	1014040	So many people contributed to this.
1014040	1018760	Obviously, just mentioning Barbara Wold was a pioneer
1018760	1023280	in both RNA-seq, as well as ChIP-seq.
1023280	1025720	And some of the sequencing technologies
1025720	1029400	that came out here are shown here.
1029400	1032840	And we will discuss those at the beginning of lecture
1032840	1033880	on Thursday.
1033880	1036960	So I encourage you to read this review here by Metzger,
1036960	1041080	which covers many of the newer sequencing technologies.
1041080	1042840	And they're pretty interesting, as you'll see.
1042840	1045920	There's interesting tricks, interesting chemistry
1045920	1049760	and image analysis tricks.
1049760	1053560	All right, so that was not very scholarly.
1053560	1056480	But if you want a sort of a proper history,
1056480	1058680	then this guy, Hellem Stevens, who
1058680	1061840	is a history of science PhD student at Harvard
1061840	1065400	and recently graduated, wrote this history
1065400	1066800	of bioinformatics.
1069920	1071280	So let's look at the syllabus.
1071280	1075920	So also, post of a seller's site is syllabus.
1075920	1077320	Looks like this.
1077320	1080400	This is quite an information-rich document.
1080400	1083480	It has all the lecture titles, all the due dates of all
1083480	1084840	the problem sets and so forth.
1084840	1086920	So please, you know, print yourself a copy
1086920	1089400	and familiarize yourself with it.
1089400	1093560	So we'll just sort of try to look at a high level first
1093560	1095960	and then sort of zoom in to the details.
1095960	1100600	So at a high level, if you look in this column here,
1100600	1106200	we've sort of broken the course into six different topics.
1106200	1111720	So there's genomic analysis one that I'll be teaching, which
1111720	1114440	is sort of more classical computational biology,
1114440	1119880	you could say, global alignment and so forth.
1119880	1122200	Then genomic analysis two, which Professor Gifford
1122200	1125000	will be teaching, covers some newer methods that
1125000	1127880	are required when you're doing a lot of second generation
1127880	1131560	sequencing, the standard algorithms are not fast enough.
1131560	1136040	You need better algorithms and so forth.
1136040	1141600	And then I will come back and give a few lectures
1141600	1143240	on modeling biological function.
1143240	1146680	This will have to do with sequence motifs, hidden markup
1146680	1149480	models, and RNA secondary structure.
1149480	1151800	Professor Frankl will then do a unit on proteomics
1151800	1153240	and protein structure.
1153240	1158120	And then there will be an extended unit on regulatory networks.
1158120	1159360	Different types of regulatory networks
1159360	1161680	will be covered with most of the lectures
1161680	1167080	by Ernest and one by David and one by Doug.
1167080	1172480	And then we'll finish up with computational genetics by David.
1172480	1177040	And there will also be some guest lectures,
1177040	1179200	one of them interspersed in regulatory networks,
1179200	1183800	and then two at the end from Ron Weiss and George Church.
1183800	1189160	So I just wanted to point out that in all of these topics,
1189160	1192640	we will include some discussion of motivating questions.
1192640	1193880	So what are the biological questions
1193880	1196800	that we're seeking to address with these approaches?
1196800	1199640	And there will also be some discussion
1199640	1201120	of the experimental methods.
1201120	1202960	So for example, in the first unit,
1202960	1204680	it's having on sequence analysis.
1204680	1208280	So we'll talk about how sequencing is done.
1208280	1212480	And then quite a bit about the interaction
1212480	1214840	between the experimental technology
1214840	1216800	and the computational analysis, which
1216800	1219520	is often involves statistical methods
1219520	1221680	for estimating the error rate of the experimental method
1221680	1223760	and things like that.
1223760	1225720	So the emphasis is on the computational part,
1225720	1231920	but we'll have some discussion about experiments.
1231920	1233560	Everyone with me so far, any questions?
1239280	1242040	All right, so what are some of these motivating questions
1242040	1243440	that we'll be talking about?
1243440	1246480	So what are the instructions encoded
1246480	1248480	in our genomes?
1248480	1250760	You know, I could think of the genome as sort of a book,
1250760	1252600	but it's in this very strange language.
1252600	1256520	And we need to understand the rules, the code,
1256520	1261760	that sort of underlies a lot of research in gene expression.
1261760	1263680	How are chromosomes organized?
1263680	1265240	What genes are present?
1265240	1267840	So tools for annotating genomes.
1267840	1270200	What regulatory circuitry is encoded?
1270200	1273480	You'd like to be able to eventually look at a genome,
1273480	1275600	understand all the regulatory elements
1275600	1277440	and be able to predict that there's
1277440	1279880	some feedback circuit there that
1279880	1283680	responds to a particular stimulation that
1283680	1286080	responds to light or nutrient deprivation
1286080	1288240	or whatever it might be.
1288240	1290240	Can the transcripto be predicted from the genome?
1290240	1293040	This is sort of a long standing question.
1293040	1297800	The translatome, if you will, let's say the proteome
1297800	1301280	can be predicted from the transcriptome in the sense
1301280	1306760	that we have a genetic code and we can look up those triplets.
1306760	1309120	So there's sort of a dream that we
1309120	1313560	would be able to model other steps in gene expression
1313560	1317880	with the precision with which the genetic code predicts
1317880	1319720	translation, that we'd be able to predict
1319720	1322080	where the polymerase would start transcribing,
1322080	1323680	where it will finish transcribing,
1323680	1328880	how a transcript will be spliced, et cetera,
1328880	1333920	all the other steps in gene expression.
1333920	1337480	And that motivates a lot of work in the field.
1337480	1339560	Can protein function be predicted from sequence?
1339560	1343240	So this is a very, very classical problem,
1343240	1346720	but there are a number of new and interesting developments
1346720	1350640	as sort of results from a lot of this high throughput
1350640	1354040	data generation, both in nucleic acid sequencing
1354040	1356800	as well as in proteomics.
1356800	1359520	Can evolutionary history be reconstructed from sequence?
1359520	1363760	Again, this has been a long standing goal of the field.
1363760	1365720	And a lot of progress has been made here in now.
1365720	1368400	Most evolutionary classifications
1368400	1372040	are actually based on molecular sequence at some level.
1372040	1378720	And new species are often are defined based on sequence.
1378720	1379800	OK.
1379800	1381200	Other motivating questions.
1381200	1383880	So what would you need to measure if you
1383880	1385960	wanted to discover the causes of a disease,
1385960	1388760	the mechanisms of existing drugs, metabolic pathways,
1388760	1389560	and microorganisms?
1389560	1391960	This is sort of a systems biology question.
1391960	1393360	You've got a new bug.
1393360	1396040	It causes some disease.
1396040	1397000	What should you measure?
1397000	1398080	Should you sequence its genome?
1398080	1399960	Should you sequence its transcriptome?
1399960	1401520	Should you do proteomics?
1401520	1403280	What type of proteomics?
1403280	1408360	Should you perturb the system in some way and do a time series?
1408360	1412080	What are the most efficient ways, what information
1412080	1414200	should be gathered, and in what quantities,
1414200	1417800	and how should that information be integrated in order
1417800	1421160	to come up with an understanding of the physiology
1421160	1424600	of that organism so that then you can know where to intervene,
1424600	1426440	what would be suitable drug targets?
1430480	1430680	Yeah.
1430680	1431800	What kind of modeling would help you
1431800	1433560	to use the data to design new therapies,
1433560	1436920	or even in a sort of a synthetic biology context
1436920	1440040	to re-engineer organisms for new purposes,
1440040	1445760	so microbes to produce fuel, for example,
1445760	1449800	or other useful products?
1449800	1451680	What can we currently measure?
1451680	1455320	What does each type of data mean individually?
1455320	1456640	What are sort of the strengths and weaknesses
1456640	1460000	of each of the types of high throughput approaches
1460000	1461600	that we have?
1461600	1465160	And how do we sort of integrate all the data
1465160	1466920	we have on a system to understand
1466920	1467960	the functioning of that system?
1467960	1470640	So these are sort of some of the questions that
1470640	1476720	motivate the latter topics on regulatory networks.
1476720	1481840	So let's now zoom in and look more closely at the core syllabus.
1481840	1484480	I've just broken it into two halves
1484480	1488520	just so you can see that it's more readable.
1488520	1491440	So today, we're going over, obviously,
1491440	1492920	of course, mechanics, mostly.
1497120	1501160	I'm sorry, on Thursday, we'll cover both some DNA sequencing
1501160	1504000	technologies, and we'll talk about local alignment blast,
1504000	1506720	more on that in a bit.
1506720	1515240	There's one of the 6.8.047 recitation 6.874.
1515240	1516280	Thank you.
1516280	1519280	Recitation will be on Friday.
1519280	1521400	The other recitations will start next week.
1521400	1525600	And then, as you can see, we'll move
1525600	1527320	through the other topics.
1527320	1528480	So each of the instructors is going
1528480	1531480	to briefly review their topic.
1531480	1534200	So I won't go through all the titles here.
1534200	1538000	But please note on the left side here
1538000	1541920	that their assignment due dates are marked.
1541920	1545560	And they're all due at noon on the indicated day.
1545560	1548200	And so some of these are problem sets.
1548200	1549920	So for example, problem set one will
1550000	1553400	be due on Thursday, February 20th at noon.
1553400	1556920	And some of the other assignments
1556920	1560120	relate to the project component of the course, which
1560120	1562640	we're going to talk more about in a moment.
1562640	1565000	In particular, we're going to ask
1565000	1570920	you to submit your brief statement of your background
1570920	1574640	and your research interests related to forming teams.
1574640	1578040	So that the projects are going to be done in teams of 1
1578040	1579320	to 5 students.
1579320	1583920	And in order to facilitate, especially
1583920	1587840	cross-disciplinary teams, if you interact with them,
1587840	1591240	maybe students in a different grad program or whatever,
1591240	1594360	you'll post your background.
1594360	1596360	I'm a first year BE student.
1596360	1599240	And I have a background in Pearl programming,
1599240	1602520	but never done Python or whatever, something like that.
1602520	1605640	And then I'm interested in modeling,
1605640	1607760	and doing systems biology, modeling
1607760	1610400	in microbial systems or something like that.
1610400	1612840	And then you can match up your interests with others
1612840	1614000	and form teams.
1614000	1617880	And then you'll come up with your own project ideas.
1617880	1619840	So the team and initial idea will
1619840	1624040	be due here, February 20, 25th.
1624040	1627960	Then you'll need to do some aims and so forth.
1627960	1630400	So the project components here, these
1630400	1633880	are only for those taking the grad version of the course.
1633880	1636280	We'll make that clear later.
1636280	1640280	So after the first three topics here,
1640280	1646160	taught by myself and David, there will be an exam,
1646160	1647200	more on that later.
1647200	1651000	And then there will be three more topics, mostly taught
1651000	1658400	by Ernest and notice their additional assignments here
1658400	1660360	related to the project, such a research strategy
1660360	1665480	and the final written report, additional problem sets.
1665480	1668360	We'll have a guest lecture here.
1668360	1670800	This will be Ron Weiss.
1670800	1673760	Then there will be the second exam.
1673760	1676200	Exams are non-cumulative, so the second exam
1676200	1682440	will discover these three topics here, and predominantly.
1682440	1686240	And then there will be another guest lecture.
1686240	1688360	This would be George Church here.
1688360	1690440	And then notice here presentations.
1690440	1695280	So those who are doing the project component,
1695280	1699240	those teams will be assigned a time
1699240	1703520	to present to the class the results of their research.
1703520	1707480	And you'll be graded.
1707480	1708920	I mean, the presentation will be sort of part
1708920	1712280	of the overall project grade assigned by the instructors.
1712280	1716440	But you'll also ask all the students in the class
1716440	1718720	to send comments on the presentations.
1718720	1721880	And so you may find that you get helpful suggestions
1721880	1724360	about interpreting your data from other people and so forth.
1724360	1729040	So that'll be a required component of the course
1729040	1733280	for all students to attend the presentations and comment on them.
1733280	1737000	And we hope that will be a lot of fun.
1737000	1739240	OK, so is this the right course for me?
1739240	1741960	So I just wanted to sort of let you know.
1741960	1744920	I might you're fortunate to have a rich selection
1744920	1748400	of courses in computational systems, synthetic biology,
1748400	1749080	here at MIT.
1749080	1752880	I've listed many of them, probably not all.
1752880	1759840	But the ones that I'm aware of that are available on campus,
1759840	1762760	757 is really only for biology grad students.
1762760	1766040	But the other courses listed here are generally open.
1766040	1768400	Some are more geared for graduate students.
1768400	1770000	Some are more undergrads.
1770000	1771280	Some are more specialized.
1771280	1774680	So for example, Jeff Gore's systems biology course
1774680	1777040	is more focused on systems biology,
1777040	1782760	whereas our course covers both computational and systems.
1782760	1783680	Keep that in mind.
1783680	1785520	Make sure you're in the right place,
1785520	1788880	that this is what you want.
1788880	1791360	OK, a few notes on the textbook.
1791360	1794040	So there is a textbook.
1794040	1796440	It's not required.
1796440	1798080	It's called understanding bioinformatics
1798080	1800040	by Svellebo and Bong.
1800040	1803280	It's quite good on certain topics.
1803280	1807600	But it really only covers about maybe a third of what
1807600	1809440	we cover in the course.
1809440	1813960	So there is good content on local alignment, global alignment,
1813960	1817080	scoring matrices, the topics of the next couple lectures.
1817080	1820280	And I'll sort of point you to those chapters.
1820280	1823160	But it's very important to emphasize
1823160	1826800	that the content of the course is really
1826800	1830480	what happens in lecture and on the homeworks.
1830480	1834360	And to some extent, what happens in recitation.
1834360	1839320	And the textbook is just there as a backup, if you will.
1839320	1841440	Or for those who would like to get
1841440	1844360	more background on the topic or want
1844360	1850640	to read a different description of that topic.
1850640	1856400	So you decide whether you want to purchase the textbook or not.
1856400	1860680	It's available at the coop or through Amazon shop around.
1860680	1862040	You can find it.
1862040	1866600	It's paperback, pretty good general reference
1866600	1868400	on a variety of topics.
1868400	1872040	But it doesn't really have much on systems biology.
1872040	1874200	All right, another important reference
1874200	1875880	that was developed specifically for this course
1875880	1879840	a few years ago is the probability and statistics
1879840	1880600	primer.
1880600	1885680	So you'll notice that some of the homeworks, particularly
1885680	1887440	in the earlier parts of the course,
1887440	1890640	will have significant probability and statistics.
1890640	1894560	And we sort of assume that you have some background
1894560	1895800	in this area.
1895800	1897120	Many of you do.
1897120	1900720	If you don't, you'll need to pick that up.
1900720	1904720	And this primer was written to provide those topics
1904720	1910760	in probability, especially that are foundational and most
1910760	1912920	relevant to computational biology.
1912920	1917560	So for example, there are some common concepts,
1917560	1922240	like p-value, probability density function,
1922240	1925760	probability mass function, cumulative distribution
1925760	1928480	function, and then common distributions,
1928480	1933040	exponential distribution, Poisson distribution,
1933040	1935360	extreme value distribution.
1935360	1939440	So maybe, hope, if those are mostly sounding familiar to you,
1939440	1940840	that's good.
1940840	1945800	If they're familiar, but you really don't,
1945800	1947960	you get binomial and Poisson confused or something,
1947960	1953160	then definitely you want to consult this primer.
1953160	1959920	So I think looking at the lectures and the homeworks,
1959920	1964480	it should probably be pretty clear which aspects are
1964480	1965560	going to be relevant.
1965560	1968440	And I'll try to point those out when possible.
1968440	1971520	And you can also consult your TAs
1971520	1974640	if you're having trouble with the probability and statistics
1974640	1975160	the content.
1975160	1977320	So we are going to focus here on really
1977320	1980400	the computational biology, bioinformatics content,
1980400	1985080	and not, we might briefly review a concept from probability,
1985080	1986640	like maybe conditional probability when
1986640	1987640	we talk about Markov chains.
1987640	1989640	But we're not going to spend a lot of time.
1989640	1990600	So if that's the first time you've
1990600	1993240	seen conditional probability, you might be a little bit lost.
1993240	1996920	So you'd be better off reading about it in advance.
1998800	2000280	OK?
2000280	2002360	Questions?
2002360	2003320	No questions.
2003320	2008520	If it's a video, it's intimidating people.
2008520	2011160	All right.
2011160	2013960	The TAs know a lot about probability and statistics.
2013960	2016320	We'll be able to help you.
2016320	2017520	OK, so homework.
2017520	2018440	So I apologize.
2018440	2020280	The font is a little bit small here,
2020280	2022080	so I'll try to state it clearly.
2022080	2026120	So there are going to be five problem
2026120	2031640	sense that are roughly one per topic,
2031640	2035320	except you'll see Pset2 covers topics two or three,
2035320	2037960	so it might be a little bit longer.
2037960	2047440	They will have the way we handle students who have to travel.
2047440	2048840	So many of you might be seniors.
2048840	2050680	You might be interviewing for graduate schools,
2050680	2053960	or you might have other conflicts with the course.
2053960	2056520	So rather than doing that on a case-by-case basis,
2056520	2060080	which we found it gets very complicated
2060080	2063040	and is not necessarily fair, the way we've set it up
2063040	2064520	is that the total number of points
2064520	2068640	available on the five homeworks is 120, OK?
2068640	2073920	But the maximum score that you can get is 100, OK?
2073920	2080960	So if you, for example, were to get 90% on all five
2080960	2085080	of the homeworks, that would be 90% of 120,
2085080	2086360	which would be 108 points.
2086360	2088840	You would get the full 100, you know,
2088840	2090720	you get 100% on your homework.
2090720	2093560	That would be a perfect score on the homework, OK?
2093560	2096120	But because of that, because there's more points available
2096120	2099280	than sort of you need, we don't allow you
2099280	2104440	to drop homeworks, OK, or to do like an alternate assignment
2104440	2106560	or something like that.
2106560	2108880	So the way it works is you can basically miss,
2108880	2113560	as long as you do well on, say, four of the homeworks,
2113560	2116560	you could actually miss one without much of a penalty.
2116560	2122080	For example, if each of the homeworks were worth 24 points
2122080	2124760	and you got perfect score on four of them,
2124760	2126800	that would be 96 points.
2126800	2129280	You would have like an almost perfect score on your homework
2129280	2131360	and you could miss that fifth homework.
2131360	2135400	Now, of course, we don't encourage you to skip that homework.
2135400	2138600	We think the homeworks are useful and are a good way
2138600	2141680	to solidify the information you've
2141680	2143560	gotten from lecture and reading and so forth.
2143560	2145800	So, you know, it's good to do them.
2145800	2148120	And doing the homeworks will help you
2148120	2150160	and perhaps prepare you for exams.
2150160	2153600	But that's sort of the way we handle the homework policy.
2153600	2155760	And I should also mention that not all the homeworks
2155760	2157840	will be the same number of points, OK?
2157840	2159960	Will, you know, a portion of the points
2159960	2162760	and the portion of the difficulty
2162760	2164360	and length of the homework assignment.
2164360	2165920	So, for example, the first homework assignment
2165920	2167800	is a little bit easier than the others.
2167800	2171120	So, it's going to have somewhat fewer points, OK?
2171120	2171920	So, late assignments.
2171920	2176400	So, all the homeworks will do it noon on the indicated day.
2176400	2179200	And if it's within 24 hours after that,
2179200	2181840	then you'll be eligible for a 50% credit.
2181840	2187320	And beyond that, you don't get any points, in part
2187320	2192240	because the TAs will be posting the answers to the homeworks, OK?
2192240	2194400	And we want to be able to post them, you know, promptly
2194400	2196760	so that, you know, you get the answers
2196760	2199880	while those problems are fresh in your mind.
2199880	2200720	Questions about homeworks?
2204080	2205560	OK, good.
2205560	2206720	So, collaboration on problem sets.
2206720	2212280	So, you know, we want you to do the problem sets.
2212280	2213280	You can do them independently.
2213280	2217440	You can work with a friend on them, or even in a group.
2217440	2218800	Discuss them together.
2218800	2221200	But write up your solutions independently.
2221200	2222680	You don't learn anything by, you know,
2222680	2225160	by copying someone else's solution.
2225160	2232400	And if the TAs see duplicate or near identical solutions,
2232400	2235560	both of those homeworks will get a zero, OK?
2235560	2237360	And this occasionally happens to be,
2237360	2239120	we don't want this to happen to you.
2239120	2241760	So, just avoid that, OK?
2241760	2246800	So, discuss together, but write up your solutions separately.
2246800	2249920	Similarly, with programming, if you have a friend
2249920	2252480	who's a more experienced programmer than you are,
2252480	2254560	you know, by all means, you know,
2254560	2256960	ask them for advice, general things.
2256960	2259240	How should I structure my program?
2259240	2263000	Do you know a function that, you know, generates a loop
2263000	2265160	or whatever it is that you need?
2265160	2270640	But, you know, don't share code with anyone else, OK?
2270640	2272280	That would be a no-no.
2272280	2275200	So, write up your code independently, OK?
2275200	2277760	And again, the graders will be looking
2277760	2282280	for identical code, and that will be thrown out, OK?
2282280	2285240	And so, we don't want to have any misconduct
2285240	2287880	of that type occurring.
2287880	2289640	All right, so, recitations.
2289640	2292480	There are three recitations sections offered each week.
2292480	2295720	Wednesday at 4, by Peter, Thursday at 4, by Colette,
2295720	2301040	Friday at 4, by Tahin, and that is a special recitation
2301040	2306480	that's required for the 6, 8, 7, 4 students, David, yes,
2306480	2309080	and has additional AI content.
2309080	2311280	So, anyone is welcome to go to that recitation,
2311280	2315040	but those who are taking 6, 8, 7, 4 must go.
2315040	2317640	The other, for students registered
2317640	2319160	for the other versions of the course,
2319160	2321040	going to recitation is optional,
2321040	2324160	but strongly recommended, because the TAs will go
2324160	2328240	over material from the lectures, material that's helpful
2328240	2330360	for the homework, so we're studying for the exams,
2330360	2335000	in the first week's Python probability as well.
2335000	2338800	So, you know, go to the recitations,
2338800	2341880	particularly if you're having trouble in the course.
2341880	2344760	So, Tahin's recitation starts this week,
2344760	2347480	and Peter and Colette's will start.
2347480	2348320	We'll start next week.
2348320	2349160	Question, yes?
2349160	2352200	What is covering the same material?
2352200	2354840	Peter and Colette will cover similar material,
2354840	2357200	and Tahin will cover different material.
2364600	2365600	Python instruction.
2365680	2370120	So, the first problem set, which will be posted this evening,
2370120	2372920	is it doesn't have any programming on it,
2372920	2375440	but if you don't have programming,
2375440	2378200	you need to start learning it very soon, okay?
2378200	2382640	And so, there will be a significant programming problem
2382640	2386240	on Pset2, and we'll be posting that problem soon,
2386240	2389400	this week, sometime, and you want to look at that
2389400	2393160	and gauge, like, how much Python do I need to learn
2393640	2395720	to at least do that problem.
2395720	2397240	So, what is this project component
2397240	2399920	that we've been hearing about?
2399920	2402520	So, here's a more concrete description.
2402520	2404800	So, again, this is only for the graduate versions
2404800	2405800	of the course.
2405800	2410400	So, students will, it basically sort of structured it,
2410400	2412280	so there's, you know, you kind of work
2412280	2416280	incrementally toward the final research project,
2416280	2418680	and so that we can offer feedback and help
2418680	2420600	along the way if needed.
2420600	2424680	So, the first assignment will be next week,
2424680	2428640	I think it's on Tuesday, where we'll have more instructions
2428640	2432160	on Thursday's lecture, but all the students registered
2432160	2434200	for the grad version will submit their background
2434200	2436480	and interest for posting on the course website,
2436480	2438040	and then you can sort of look at those
2438040	2441560	and try to find other students who have ideally similar
2441560	2444680	interests, but perhaps somewhat different backgrounds.
2444680	2448840	It's particularly helpful to have a strong biologist
2448840	2450920	on the team, and perhaps a strong programmer
2450920	2451960	would help as well.
2453320	2457720	So, then you will choose your teams
2457720	2461640	and submit a project title and one paragraph summary
2461640	2464680	that will, you know, the basic idea of your project.
2464680	2468760	Now, we are not providing a menu of research projects,
2468760	2472320	it's your choice, whatever you wanna do,
2472320	2474320	as long as it's related to computational
2474320	2477600	and systems biology, so it could be analysis
2477600	2481680	of some publicly available data, could be analysis
2481680	2484680	of some data that you got during your rotation,
2484680	2486720	or for those of you who are already in labs
2486720	2489920	that you're actually working on, it's totally fine
2489920	2492160	and encouraged that the project be something
2492160	2496920	that's related to your main PhD work
2496920	2501920	if you've started on that, and it could also be more
2502160	2505160	sort of in the modeling, some modeling with MATLAB
2505160	2507760	or something, if you're familiar with that.
2507760	2510680	But variety of possibilities will have more information
2510680	2513920	on this later, but we want you to form teams.
2513920	2518760	The teams can work independently, or with up to four friends
2518760	2522840	in teams of five, and if people wanna have a giant team
2522840	2524360	to do some really challenging project,
2524360	2527120	then you can come and discuss with us,
2527120	2529920	and we'll see if that would work.
2530920	2534800	So then there's the initial title
2534800	2537360	in one paragraph summary, we'll give you a little feedback
2537360	2540480	on that, and then you'll submit an actual
2540480	2544240	specific aims document, so with actual NIH-style
2544240	2547520	specific aims, the goal is to understand
2547520	2550200	whether this organism has operons or not,
2550200	2554200	or whatever, some actual scientific question,
2554200	2558120	and a bit about how you will undertake that,
2558160	2563160	and then you'll submit a longer two-page research strategy,
2564040	2567120	which will include specifically, we will use these data,
2567120	2570160	where we use this software, these statistical approaches,
2570160	2573520	that sort of thing, and then toward the end
2573520	2575720	of the semester, a final written report will be due
2575720	2579400	to that'll be five pages, you'll work on it together,
2579400	2581800	but it'll need to be clear who did what,
2581800	2584120	you'll need an author contribution statement,
2584120	2586640	so and so did this analysis, so and so wrote this section
2586680	2590200	and that sort of thing, and then as I mentioned before,
2590200	2592960	there will be oral presentations by each team
2592960	2596680	on the last two course sessions, okay?
2598640	2600440	Questions about docs?
2600440	2603800	There's more information on the course info document online.
2606960	2607800	Okay, good.
2609880	2614880	Yes, so for those taking six, eight, seven, four,
2615080	2618440	in addition to the project, there will also be additional
2618440	2623160	AI problems on both the P-sets and exam, David?
2623160	2624000	Yes, okay.
2627120	2630320	And they're optional for others, okay.
2630320	2632200	All right, good.
2632200	2635520	Okay, so how are we gonna do the exam?
2635520	2638440	So there's, as I mentioned, there's two 80-minute exams,
2638440	2640560	they're non-cumulative, so the first exam covers basically
2640560	2644480	the first three topics, second exam on the last three topics,
2644480	2647600	there are 80 minutes there during normal class time,
2648920	2652600	there's no final exam, the grading,
2652600	2655440	so for those taking the undergrad version,
2655440	2659320	the homeworks will count 36% out of the maximum 100 points
2660400	2664000	and the exams will count 62%,
2664000	2666680	and then this peer review where there's two days
2666680	2668520	where you go and you listen to presentations
2668520	2672320	and you submit comments online counts, counts 2%, okay?
2672320	2676000	For the graduate bioBEHST versions,
2676000	2681000	it's 30% homeworks, 48% exams, 20% project,
2681500	2686500	2% peer review, for the EECS version, six, eight, seven, four,
2686760	2690200	25% homework, 48% exams, 20% project,
2690200	2693620	and then 5% for these extra AI-related problems,
2694520	2697320	and 2% peer review, and those should add up to 100,
2697320	2702080	and then in addition, we will award 1% extra credit
2702080	2705360	for outstanding class participation.
2705360	2709100	So questions, comments, during class.
2712560	2715720	All right, so a few announcements about topic one,
2715720	2719880	and then each of us will sort of review the topics
2719880	2721200	that are coming up.
2721200	2723040	So PSET one will be posted tonight,
2723040	2725440	it's due February 20th at noon,
2725440	2728520	it involves basic microbiology, probability, and statistics,
2728520	2729880	could be some experience with BLAST
2729880	2731800	and some of the statistics associated.
2731800	2735320	PSET two will be posted later this week,
2735320	2738640	so you don't need to obviously start on PSET two yet,
2738640	2740280	it's not due for several weeks,
2740280	2742720	but definitely look at the programming problem
2742720	2745120	to give you an idea of what's involved
2745120	2748660	and what to focus on when you're reviewing your Python.
2749800	2752160	Mention the probability stats primer,
2752160	2755120	sequencing technology, so for Thursday's lecture,
2755120	2759320	it'll be very helpful if you read the review by Metzger
2759320	2761560	on next-gen sequencing technologies.
2761720	2765200	It's pretty well written, covers Illumina 454,
2765200	2767920	PacBio, and a few other interesting
2767920	2769040	sequence technologies.
2771000	2773240	Other background readings, so we'll be talking about
2773240	2776280	local alignment, global alignment, statistics,
2776280	2779320	and similarity matrices for the next two lectures,
2779320	2781360	and chapters four and five of the textbook
2781360	2783760	provide a pretty good background on these topics,
2783760	2786140	I encourage you to take a look.
2787720	2790400	Okay, so I'm just gonna briefly review my lectures,
2790400	2793280	and then we'll have David and Ernest do the same,
2793280	2797400	so sequencing technologies will be beginning of lecture two,
2797400	2802400	and then we'll talk about local un-gapped sequence alignment,
2803920	2807520	particular blast, so blast is something like
2807520	2811200	the Google search engine of bioinformatics, if you will,
2811200	2813920	it's one of the most widely used tools,
2813920	2816360	and it's important to understand something about
2816360	2818440	how it works, and in particular how to evaluate
2818440	2820600	the significance of blast hits,
2820600	2824200	which are described by this extreme value distribution.
2826880	2829200	All right, and then lecture three,
2829200	2831880	we'll talk about global alignment,
2831880	2835000	and introducing gaps into sequence alignments.
2835000	2839280	We'll talk about some dynamic programming algorithms,
2839280	2843280	Needleman-Wench, Smith-Waterman, and in lecture four,
2843280	2846120	we'll talk about comparative genomic analysis
2846120	2847800	of gene regulation.
2847800	2851760	So using sequence similarity across genomes
2851760	2854800	to infer location of regulatory elements,
2854800	2858500	such as microRNA target sites, other things like that.
2859560	2861760	All right, so I think this is now,
2861760	2864000	oh, sorry, a few more lectures.
2864000	2867520	Then in the next unit, modeling biological function,
2868600	2871080	I'll talk about the problem of motif finding,
2871080	2876080	so searching a set of sequences for a common subsequence
2876640	2880840	or similar subsequences that possess
2880840	2884160	a particular biological function, like binding to a protein.
2884160	2885560	It's often a complex search space.
2885560	2887360	We'll talk about the Gibbs sampling algorithm
2887360	2888760	and some alternatives.
2888760	2892040	And then in lecture 10, we'll talk about Markov
2892040	2894880	and Hidden Markov models, which have been called
2894880	2899640	the Legos of Bioinformatics, which can be used
2899640	2904640	to model a variety of sort of linear sequence labeling problems.
2905280	2910280	And then on the last lecture of that unit,
2910520	2912560	I'll talk a little bit about protein,
2912560	2914600	I'm sorry, about RNA secondary structure,
2914600	2919400	so the base pairing of RNAs,
2919400	2922200	predicting it from thermodynamic tools,
2922200	2926640	as well as comparative genomic approaches.
2926640	2930200	And you'll learn about the Enfold tool
2930200	2932360	and how you can use a diagram like that
2932360	2936360	to infer that this RNA may have different possible structures
2936360	2939600	that I can fold into, like those shown here.
2939600	2942680	All right, so I'm gonna pass it off to David.
2951320	2952440	Thanks very much, Chris.
2954840	2958200	Right, so I'm David Gifford, and I'm delighted to be here.
2958200	2960560	It's really a wonderfully exciting time
2960560	2962920	in computational biology.
2962920	2964600	And one of the reasons it's so exciting
2964600	2968400	is shown on this slide, which is the production
2968400	2971480	of DNA-based sequence per instrument over time.
2971480	2974200	And as you can see, it's just amazingly
2975560	2977680	more efficient as time goes forward.
2977680	2980560	And if you think about the reciprocal of this curve,
2980560	2984080	the cost per base is basically becoming extraordinarily low.
2984960	2988800	And this kind of instrument allows us to produce
2988800	2991480	hundreds of millions of sequence reads
2991480	2993720	for a single experiment.
2993720	2995960	And thus, do we not only need new computational methods
2995960	2999040	to handle this kind of a big data problem,
2999040	3000440	but we need computational methods
3000440	3003680	to represent the results in computational models.
3003680	3006760	And so we have multiple challenges computationally
3006760	3009640	because modern biology really can't be done
3009640	3011680	outside of a computational framework.
3012960	3016640	And to summarize the way people have adapted
3016680	3018960	these high throughput DNA sequencing instruments,
3018960	3021040	I built this small figure for you.
3021040	3023280	And you can see that Professor Burge
3023280	3026480	would talk about DNA sequencing next time.
3026480	3028280	And obviously, you can use DNA sequencing
3028280	3030160	to sequence your own genomes,
3030160	3033840	or the genomes of your favorite pet or whatever you like.
3033840	3035960	And so we'll talk about in lecture six
3035960	3038320	how to actually do genome sequencing.
3038320	3041600	And one of the challenges in doing genome sequencing
3041600	3044400	is how to actually find what you have sequenced.
3044400	3047600	And we'll be talking about how map sequence reads as well.
3048600	3050160	Another way to use DNA sequencing
3050160	3053160	is to take the RNA species present in a single cell
3053160	3054880	or in a population of cells
3054880	3058680	and convert them into DNA using reverse transcript days.
3058680	3060640	Then we can sequence the DNA
3060640	3062640	and understand the RNA complement of the cell,
3062640	3065280	which of course, either can be used as messenger RNA
3065280	3068840	to code for protein or for structural RNAs
3068840	3070720	or for non-coding RNAs that have other kinds
3070720	3072720	of functions associated with chromatin.
3074800	3078200	In lecture seven, we'll be talking about protein DNA interactions
3078200	3079920	with Professor Burge already mentioned.
3079920	3083560	The idea that we can actually locate all the regulatory factors
3083560	3084640	associated with the genome
3084640	3086640	using a single high throughput experiment.
3087920	3090000	We do this by isolating the proteins
3090000	3092080	and their associated DNA fragments
3092080	3093440	and sequencing the DNA fragments
3093440	3095720	using this DNA sequencing technology.
3097000	3102000	So briefly, the first thing that we'll look at in lecture five
3102920	3104640	is given a reference genome sequence
3104640	3107240	and a basket of DNA sequence reads,
3107240	3109600	how do we build an efficient index
3109600	3112440	so that we can either map or align those reads
3112440	3114400	back to the reference genome?
3114400	3116880	That's a very important and fundamental problem
3116880	3119480	because if I give you a basket of 200 million reads,
3119480	3123160	we need to build this alignment very, very rapidly
3123160	3124960	and quickly and accurately,
3124960	3128360	especially in the context of repetitive elements
3128360	3131280	because a genome obviously has many repeats in it
3131280	3132960	and we need to consider how our indexing
3132960	3134480	and searching algorithms are going to handle
3134480	3136520	those sorts of elements.
3136520	3138720	In the next lecture, we'll talk about
3138720	3142160	how to actually sequence a genome and assemble it.
3142160	3144440	So the fundamental way that we approach genome sequencing
3144440	3146360	given today's sequencing instruments
3146360	3149320	is that we take intact chromosomes at the top,
3149320	3151760	which of course are hundreds of millions of bases along
3151760	3153960	and we shatter them into pieces.
3153960	3157320	And then we sequence size selected pieces
3157320	3159320	in a sequencing instrument
3159360	3161680	and then we need to put the jigsaw puzzle back together
3161680	3163840	with a computational assembler.
3163840	3166520	So we're talking about assembly algorithms,
3166520	3169000	how they work and furthermore,
3169000	3172120	how to resolve ambiguities as we put that puzzle together,
3172120	3175120	which often arise in the context of repetitive sequence.
3176280	3178480	And in the next lecture seven,
3178480	3180960	we'll be looking at how to actually take
3180960	3184480	those little DNA molecules that are associated with proteins
3184480	3187000	and analyze them to figure out
3187040	3189840	where particular proteins are bound to the genome
3189840	3191480	and how they might regulate target genes.
3191480	3194000	Here we see two different occurrences
3194000	3196000	of octave or binding events
3196000	3197960	binding approximately to the SOCs to gene,
3197960	3199120	which they are regulating.
3201280	3205840	So that's the beginning of our analysis
3205840	3210840	of DNA sequencing and then we'll look at RNA sequencing.
3212560	3214640	Once again, we're going through our DNA intermediate
3214640	3218040	and ask the question, how can we look at
3218040	3219840	the expression of particular genes
3219840	3223680	by mapping RNA sequence reads back onto the genome?
3223680	3226880	And there are two fundamental questions we can address here,
3226880	3231880	which is what is the level of expression of a given gene
3231880	3235880	and secondarily, what isoforms are being expressed?
3235880	3238240	The second sets of reads you see up on the screen
3238240	3241960	are split reads that cross splice junctions.
3241960	3245760	And so by looking at how reads aligning to the genome,
3245760	3249180	we can figure out which particular exons are included
3249180	3252000	or excluded from a particular transcript.
3253760	3257400	So that's the beginning of sort of the high throughput biology,
3257400	3261840	genomic analysis module, and I'll be returning to SOC
3261840	3265320	later in the term about computational genetics,
3265320	3267400	which really is a way to summarize everything
3267400	3271000	we're learning in the course into an applicable way
3271040	3274080	to ask fundamental questions about genome function,
3274080	3276320	which Professor Burge talked about earlier.
3278000	3282320	Now, we all have about three billion bases
3282320	3285000	out in our genomes and as you know,
3285000	3287680	you differ from the individual sitting next to you
3287680	3291680	about in one and every thousand base pairs on average.
3291680	3294800	And so one question is how do we actually interpret
3294800	3297920	these differences between genomes
3297920	3300880	and how can we build accurate computational models
3300880	3304560	that allow us to infer function from genome sequence?
3305400	3307160	And that's a pretty big challenge.
3308040	3313040	So we'll start by asking questions about
3313080	3314720	what parts of the genome are active
3314720	3316320	and how can we annotate them?
3317440	3319720	So we can use once again different kinds
3319720	3322280	of sequencing based assays
3322280	3324240	to identify the regions of the genome
3324240	3327240	that are active in any given cellular state.
3327240	3329720	And furthermore, if we look at different cells,
3329720	3331400	we can tell which parts of the genome
3331400	3333240	are differentially active.
3333240	3335640	Here you can see the active chromatin
3335640	3338240	during the differentiation of an ESL
3338240	3341520	into a terminal type over a 50 kilobase window
3341520	3344080	and the regions of the genome that are sheeted in yellow
3344080	3348000	represent regions that are differentially active.
3348000	3352160	And so using this kind of DNA-seq data and other data,
3352160	3354840	we can automatically annotate the genome
3354840	3356840	with where the regulatory elements are
3356880	3359920	and begin to understand what the regulatory code
3359920	3360920	of the genome is.
3362560	3365600	So once we understand what parts of the genome are active,
3365600	3367960	we can ask questions about how do they contribute
3367960	3369560	to some overall phenotype.
3370720	3374280	And our next lecture, our lecture 19,
3374280	3377440	we'll be looking at how we can build a model
3377440	3380920	of a quantitative trait based upon multiple loci
3380920	3383880	and the particular alleles that are present at that loci.
3383880	3387040	So here you see an example of a bunch
3387040	3389080	of different quantitative trait loci
3389080	3390800	that are contributing to the growth rate
3390800	3392360	of yeast in a given condition.
3393400	3397760	So part of our exploration during this term
3397760	3400080	will be to develop computational methods
3400080	3403040	to automatically identify regions of the genome
3403040	3406480	that control such traits and to decide the significance.
3407760	3410680	And finally, we'd like to put all this together
3410680	3412800	and ask a very fundamental question,
3412800	3415520	which is that how do we assign variations
3415520	3420520	in the human genome to differential risk for human disease?
3420520	3422200	And associated questions are,
3422200	3424360	how can we assign those variants
3424360	3426960	to what best therapy would be applied to the disease,
3426960	3430360	what therapeutics might be used, for example.
3430360	3433920	And here we have a bunch of results
3433920	3436240	from genome-wide association studies,
3436240	3439160	started with bipolar disorder at the bottom
3439160	3441440	as type two diabetes.
3441440	3443480	And looking along the chromosomes,
3443480	3447080	we're asking which locations along the genome
3447080	3449320	have variants that are highly associated
3449320	3451440	with these particular diseases
3451440	3453040	in these so-called Manhattan plots
3453040	3456040	because the things that stick up look like buildings.
3456040	3459320	And so these sorts of studies are yielding,
3459320	3463000	very interesting insights into variants
3463000	3465800	that are associated with human disease.
3465800	3466800	And the next step, of course,
3466800	3469320	is to figure out how to actually prove
3469320	3471680	that these variants are causal
3471680	3473920	and also to look at mechanisms
3473920	3475560	where we might be able to address
3475560	3478200	what kinds of therapeutics might be applied
3478200	3480360	to deal with these diseases.
3480360	3481920	So those are my two units.
3481920	3485080	Once again, high throughput genomic analysis
3485080	3487880	and secondarily computational genetics.
3487880	3491160	And finally, if you have any questions about 6874,
3491160	3492160	I'll be here after lecture.
3492160	3493880	Feel free to ask me.
3493880	3494720	Alright.
3499320	3506320	Thank you very much, Dave.
3506320	3508640	Alright, so in the preceding lectures,
3508640	3510520	you'll have heard a lot about the amazing things
3510520	3513120	we can learn from nucleic acid sequencing.
3513120	3515280	And what we're going to do in the latter part of the course
3515280	3517240	is look at other modalities in cell.
3517240	3519960	Obviously, there's a lot that goes on inside of cells
3519960	3523120	that's not taking place in level of DNA RNA.
3523120	3525160	So we're going to start to look at proteins,
3525160	3527360	protein interactions, and ultimately,
3527360	3529640	protein interaction networks.
3529640	3531840	So we'll start with the smallest scale,
3531840	3534160	looking at intermolecular interactions
3534160	3536720	of the biophysics, the fundamental biophysics
3536720	3537880	protein structure.
3537880	3540240	Then we'll start to look at protein-protein interactions
3540240	3543520	and I said the final level of the networks.
3543520	3545840	There's been an amazing advance in our ability
3545840	3547680	to predict protein structure.
3547680	3550400	So it's always been the dream of computational biology
3550400	3552880	to be able to go from the sequence of a gene
3552880	3555560	to the structure of the corresponding protein.
3555560	3557560	And ever since Antonson, we know that at least that
3557560	3560040	should be theoretically possible for a lot of proteins.
3560040	3561520	But it's been computationally virtually
3561520	3563480	intractable until quite recently.
3563480	3564840	And a number of different approaches
3564840	3567000	have allowed us to predict protein structure.
3567000	3568680	So this slide shows, for example,
3568680	3570680	I don't know which one's which, but in blue,
3570680	3573360	perhaps, prediction in red, the true structure
3573360	3575320	they were around, but you can see it doesn't matter very much.
3575320	3578280	We're getting extremely accurate predictions
3578280	3580640	of small protein structure.
3580640	3582200	There are a variety of approaches here
3582200	3583760	that live on a spectrum.
3583760	3587240	On the one hand, there's the computational approach
3587240	3589880	that tries to make special purpose hardware
3589880	3592840	to carry out the calculations for protein structure.
3592840	3594280	And that's been wildly successful.
3594280	3596360	And the other end of the extreme, there's
3596360	3598440	been the crowdsourcing approach to have gamers
3598440	3599960	try to predict protein structure.
3599960	3601680	And that turns out to be successful.
3601680	3604280	And there's a lot of interesting computational approaches
3604280	3605160	in the middle as well.
3605160	3609040	So we'll explore some of these different strategies.
3609040	3611800	Then the ability to go from just saying a single protein
3611800	3613960	structure to how these protein interacts.
3613960	3617000	So now there are pretty good algorithms predicting protein
3617000	3618800	protein interactions as well.
3618800	3620040	And that allows us then to figure out
3620040	3622200	not how these proteins function individually,
3622200	3625480	but how they begin to function as a network.
3625480	3627200	Now, one of the things that we've already
3627200	3628960	going to be touched on early parts of the course
3628960	3632880	are protein DNA interactions through sequencing approaches.
3632880	3634880	We want to now look at them at a regulatory level.
3634880	3638920	And could you reconstruct the regulation of a genome
3638920	3641040	by predicting the protein DNA interactions?
3641040	3642920	And there's been a lot of work here.
3642920	3645840	We talked earlier about Eric Davidson's pioneering
3645840	3648600	approaches, a lot of interesting computational approaches
3648600	3651660	as well, that go from the relatively simple models
3651660	3654280	who saw on those earlier slides to these very complicated
3654280	3655800	networks that you see here.
3655800	3658680	We'll look at what these networks actually tell us,
3658680	3661720	how much information is really encoded in them.
3661720	3664280	They are certainly pretty, whatever they are.
3664280	3666760	We'll look at other kinds of interaction networks.
3666760	3669880	We'll look at genetic interaction networks as well.
3669880	3671400	And perhaps some other kinds.
3671400	3673440	And finally, we'll look at computable models.
3673440	3674480	And what do we mean by that?
3674480	3677920	We mean models that make some kind of very specific prediction,
3677920	3679800	whether it's a Boolean prediction.
3679800	3681920	This gene will be on or off, or perhaps an even more
3681920	3683360	quantitative prediction.
3683360	3686080	So we'll look at logic-based modeling and probably
3686080	3688480	Bayesian networks as well.
3688480	3692200	So that's been a very whirlwind tour of the course.
3692200	3693760	Just to go back to mechanics, make
3693760	3696080	sure you're signed up for the right course.
3696080	3697960	The undergraduate versions of the course
3697960	3700080	do not have a project.
3700080	3702800	And they certainly do not have the artificial intelligence
3702800	3703760	problems.
3703760	3705120	Then there are the graduate versions
3705120	3707040	that have the project, but not have the I.
3707040	3709480	And finally, the 687-4, which has both.
3709480	3712640	So please be sure you're in the right class
3712640	3716440	so you get credit for the right assignments.
3716440	3719280	And finally, if you've got any questions about the course
3719280	3720480	mechanics, we have a few minutes.
3720480	3722680	We can talk about it here and from everybody.
3722680	3725000	And then we'll all be available after class,
3725000	3726800	a little bit to answer questions.
3726800	3729160	So please, any questions?
3729160	3729600	Yes?
3729600	3731000	Can undergrad students ever?
3731000	3732280	Can't undergrad students ever?
3732280	3735800	Well, they can sign up for the graduate version, absolutely.
3735800	3736880	Other questions?
3736880	3737400	Yes?
3737400	3742560	Yeah, I actually can't make other of those sessions.
3742560	3745000	I'll send an email to the staff list, and we'll see what
3745000	3745600	we can do.
3749080	3749840	Other questions?
3753200	3754200	Yes?
3754200	3758480	687 doesn't exist in a constitutional evolutionary
3758480	3759800	biology class.
3759800	3761920	Oh, the thing we list as alternative classes?
3761920	3762400	Sorry.
3762400	3763600	We'll pick that.
3763600	3764600	Very simple.
3764600	3766200	I think it's still happening.
3766200	3768000	Yeah, I mean it.
3768000	3770280	We'll delete it from our slides, yes.
3774840	3778440	We are powerful, but not that powerful.
3778440	3779680	Other questions?
3779680	3780680	Comments?
3780680	3781800	Critiques?
3781800	3783000	Yes, in the back?
3783000	3786720	Are each of the exams equally weighted?
3786720	3789960	Yes, they are.
3789960	3790480	Yes?
3790480	3794360	We're in 687 and before we have the additional AI problems.
3794360	3797200	Does that mean that we have more questions on the exam
3797200	3801200	but just as much time through them?
3801200	3802880	The question was, if you're in 687,
3802880	3805280	for any of the additional AI questions on the exam,
3805280	3807200	does that mean you have more questions
3807200	3808480	but the same amount of time?
3808480	3811880	And I believe the answer to that is yes.
3812760	3814600	We may revisit that question.
3814600	3816760	We will revisit that question a little later today.
3820760	3823200	But of course, six students are just so much smarter
3823200	3825800	than everyone else, right?
3825800	3826320	Yes?
3826320	3828840	Can you say the different versions of class by the ad?
3828840	3830080	I'm sorry, can you say that again?
3830080	3832800	Can you say the different versions of class by the ad?
3832800	3834760	Can you switch between different versions of class
3834760	3836760	by the ad drop deadline?
3836760	3838360	In principle, yes.
3838360	3840760	But if you haven't done the work for that,
3840760	3843080	then you will be in trouble.
3843080	3844880	And there may not be a smooth mechanism
3844880	3846640	for making up missed work that late
3846640	3848720	because the ad drop deadline is rather late.
3848720	3851880	So I encourage you, if you're considering doing
3851880	3853200	the more intensive version or not,
3853200	3855240	sign up for the more intensive version,
3855240	3857320	you can always drop back.
3857320	3860040	Once we form groups though for the projects,
3860040	3861880	then obviously there is an aspect
3861880	3863080	of letting down your teammates.
3863080	3866160	So think carefully now about which one you want to join.
3866160	3868560	It'll be hard to switch between them
3868560	3870600	but we'll do whatever the registrar requires us to do
3870600	3872920	in terms of allowing it.
3872920	3874920	Other questions?
3874920	3875920	Yes.
3875920	3876920	Yes.
3876920	3877920	The other side remains separate.
3877920	3879400	Can we access undergrads?
3879400	3881560	Access the AI problems just?
3881560	3882560	Yes.
3882560	3883560	Yes.
3883560	3885960	You will be, if the course sites remain separate,
3885960	3888200	we'll undergrads be able to access the AI problems.
3888200	3889800	The answer is yes.
3891800	3892800	Yes.
3892800	3896200	Student 6, 8, 7, 4, 10, 4, 10, 4, 10, 4, 10, 4, 10, 4, 10?
3896200	3898000	Should students in 6, 8, 7, 4, 10,
3898000	3899640	both presentations not necessary?
3899640	3901160	You're welcome to both, if you want,
3901160	3906920	but the course 6 rest stations should be sufficient.
3906920	3910520	Other questions?
3910520	3911520	Yes.
3911520	3914840	What's covered in the normal rest stations?
3914840	3916280	What's covered in the normal rest stations?
3916280	3918600	It'll be reinforcing material that's in the lectures.
3918600	3921360	So the goal is not to introduce any new material
3921360	3927040	in the course 20, course 7, rest stations.
3927120	3930520	Just glad I had not to introduce any new material.
3930520	3931200	Other questions?
3934680	3935360	OK, great.
3935360	3938320	And we'll hang around a little bit to answer any remaining
3938320	3940400	questions that may come up.
